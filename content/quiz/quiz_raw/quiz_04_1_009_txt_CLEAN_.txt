⭐️Question 3:
Real-world scenario: You added a second image and noticed it’s automatically resized just like the first one. Why is that happening?

1️⃣ Answer 1:
They have different URLs, but the browser resizes them the same by default.
😎Why:
Why? The browser doesn’t automatically resize images based on similarity. CSS selectors do that.
--

2️⃣ ✅ Answer 2:
The CSS tag selector img applies the same width property to both images.
😎Why:
Why? The tag selector targets all img elements, so any new image inherits the same CSS rule.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
The HTML automatically adjusts size when there are multiple images.
😎Why:
Why? HTML doesn’t adjust size on its own; only CSS can style multiple elements this way.

⭐️Question 5:
Slightly challenging: What happens if you add a second CSS rule with img selector and a different width value after the first rule?

1️⃣ Answer 1:
Both rules cancel each other out and nothing is applied.
😎Why:
Why? CSS does not cancel rules; it uses the last rule in order when selectors are equal.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
Only the first rule is applied and the second one is ignored.
😎Why:
Why? Later CSS rules override earlier ones if they have the same selector specificity.
--

3️⃣ ✅ Answer 3:
The second rule overrides the first one, applying its width value to all images.
😎Why:
Why? In CSS, when selectors are the same, the one that appears last in the code is used.
