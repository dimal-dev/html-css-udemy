⭐️Question 1:
What’s the key difference between a tag selector and a class selector in CSS?

1️⃣ Answer 1:
A tag selector is used only for links, while a class selector is used for images.
😎Why:
Why? Tag selectors can target any HTML tag (like p, a, img), not just links.
--

2️⃣ ✅ Answer 2:
A tag selector targets all elements of a type, while a class selector targets elements with a specific class.
😎Why:
Why? Tag selectors apply styles to all elements of a specific HTML tag, class selectors target elements with a specific class name.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
A tag selector uses a dot before the name, while a class selector does not.
😎Why:
Why? It’s the other way around—class selectors use a dot before the name, tag selectors do not.

⭐️Question 2:
You add the same class to three different images. What happens when you apply a CSS rule to that class?

1️⃣ Answer 1:
Only the first image will be affected by the CSS rule.
😎Why:
Why? Class selectors apply the style to all elements with that class, not just the first one.
--

2️⃣ ✅ Answer 2:
All three images will be styled according to the CSS rule.
😎Why:
Why? Class selectors are designed to apply styles to any element that shares the specified class name.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
The rule will only work if each image has a different class name.
😎Why:
Why? One class can be used on multiple elements, and the rule still applies to all of them.

⭐️Question 3:
Real-world case: You want your company logo to be larger than the other images on the page. What’s the best way to do that with CSS?

1️⃣ ✅ Answer 1:
Add a class to the logo image and write a CSS rule that targets that class.
😎Why:
Why? Class selectors let you target and style specific elements individually—even if they’re the same tag as others.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
Use multiple tag selectors to style the images differently.
😎Why:
Why? You can't differentiate images with tag selectors alone—they target all <img> tags.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
Move the logo to a new HTML page to isolate its style.
😎Why:
Why? That’s unnecessary and inefficient. Class selectors exist exactly for cases like this.

⭐️Question 4:
Which of the following is the correct CSS selector to target an element with class="header-img"?

1️⃣ ✅ Answer 1:
.header-img
😎Why:
Why? The dot at the beginning signals a class selector and must match the exact class name.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
#header-img
😎Why:
Why? That’s an ID selector, not a class selector. Class selectors use a dot prefix.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
header-img
😎Why:
Why? This isn’t a valid selector on its own—it needs a dot to be a class selector or must be an actual HTML tag to be a tag selector.

⭐️Question 5:
You name a class “main-image” in your CSS but accidentally write class="main_img" in your HTML. What will happen?

1️⃣ Answer 1:
The browser will automatically correct the name and apply the styles.
😎Why:
Why? Browsers do not fix incorrect class names. They must match exactly for the CSS to work.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
Both styles will be applied.
😎Why:
Why? If the names don’t match, the style rule won’t apply to that HTML element at all.
--

3️⃣ ✅ Answer 3:
The style will not apply because the names don’t match exactly.
😎Why:
Why? Class selectors are case-sensitive and require an exact match with the class name in HTML.
