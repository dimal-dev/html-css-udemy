⭐️Question 1:
Why should the :active pseudo-class be written after the :hover pseudo-class in your CSS?

1️⃣ ✅ Answer 1:
Because otherwise :hover will override :active styles
😎Why:
Why? CSS reads from top to bottom, so placing :active after ensures it applies correctly when clicking.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
Because :hover doesn’t work if placed after :active
😎Why:
Why? :hover will still work if placed after; the issue is about overriding styles.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
Because it’s required by the HTML standard
😎Why:
Why? It's a CSS convention for specificity and override control, not a strict standard.

⭐️Question 2:
What’s the effect of changing the font-size of a link on hover?

1️⃣ ✅ Answer 1:
The text and background shrink proportionally
😎Why:
Why? When font-size decreases, the content and its padding shrink, reducing the visual size.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
Only the text shrinks but the background stays the same
😎Why:
Why? Padding and content affect the background, so both shrink.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
The link disappears on hover
😎Why:
Why? Font-size changes don’t make a link disappear unless it’s set to 0.

⭐️Question 3:
What CSS property is used to animate a smooth change in size or color?

1️⃣ Answer 1:
animate
😎Why:
Why? animate is not a valid CSS property; the correct one is transition.
--

2️⃣ ✅ Answer 2:
transition
😎Why:
Why? transition enables smooth changes between CSS states over time.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
transform
😎Why:
Why? transform changes appearance instantly, but does not animate transitions.

⭐️Question 4:
What happens if you put the transition property only in the :hover selector?

1️⃣ Answer 1:
The transition works in both directions
😎Why:
Why? It only applies when hovering in, not when leaving hover.
--

2️⃣ ✅ Answer 2:
The element transitions smoothly on hover, but snaps back instantly
😎Why:
Why? Because transition is only present during hover, it doesn't apply when the cursor leaves.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
The transition is applied permanently
😎Why:
Why? CSS pseudo-classes like :hover only apply temporarily during interaction.

⭐️Question 5:
Which of the following transitions would affect both font-size and background-color?

1️⃣ Answer 1:
transition: color 0.5s;
😎Why:
Why? This only affects color, not font-size or background-color.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
transition: all 0.5s;
😎Why:
Why? While this works, the lesson focuses on listing properties explicitly.
--

3️⃣ ✅ Answer 3:
transition: font-size 0.5s, background-color 0.5s;
😎Why:
Why? This transition specifically targets font-size and background-color with timing for both.

⭐️Question 6:
Diagnostic: Why might your transition not be visible after clicking a link?

1️⃣ ✅ Answer 1:
Because the page reloads immediately
😎Why:
Why? Clicking a link with href causes a page reload, interrupting any visual transition.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
You used an RGB color instead of HEX
😎Why:
Why? Both formats work; it's not related to transitions being cut short.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
The background color is set to white
😎Why:
Why? The background color being white doesn’t prevent a transition from occurring.

⭐️Question 7:
Slightly challenging: You want the link to shrink slightly and change color smoothly on hover. What do you need?

1️⃣ ✅ Answer 1:
A hover rule changing font-size and background-color, plus a transition on the base selector
😎Why:
Why? The hover rule defines the changes, and the transition in the default rule makes them smooth.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
Only a transition property inside the hover rule
😎Why:
Why? That would only animate the "in" state, not when the cursor leaves.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
A hover rule with padding and color keywords only
😎Why:
Why? Padding and keywords don’t affect font-size or smoothness unless combined with transition.
