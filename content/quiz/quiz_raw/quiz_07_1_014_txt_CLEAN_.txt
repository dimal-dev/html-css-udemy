⭐️Question 3:
Which of the following is the correct syntax for using the :hover pseudoclass on a tag selector?

1️⃣ ✅ Answer 1:
a:hover { color: red; }
😎Why:
Why? This is the correct syntax: selector, colon, pseudoclass, then style declarations.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
:hover a { color: red; }
😎Why:
Why? The colon pseudoclass must come after the selector, not before.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
a { :hover { color: red; } }
