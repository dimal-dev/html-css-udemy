⭐️Question 8:
Why would a color not appear even though you set it using RGB numbers?

1️⃣ Answer 1:
Because RGB is not supported in browsers
😎Why:
Why? All modern browsers support RGB. It’s likely a syntax issue.
--

2️⃣ ✅ Answer 2:
Because you forgot to include "rgb()" around the numbers
😎Why:
Why? Without "rgb()", the values are treated as invalid by the browser.

⭐️Question 9:
Real-life scenario: You want a button to be dark blue by default, turn bright blue on hover, and light blue when clicked. What’s the best way to code this?

1️⃣ ✅ Answer 1:
Use three CSS rules: one normal, one with :hover, and one with :active, each with a different background-color
😎Why:
Why? This method lets you set different colors for each interaction state.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
Apply one background-color in a single CSS rule
😎Why:
Why? That would set only one color, not different ones for hover and click.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
Set a color animation in HTML
😎Why:
Why? Color animations should be done with CSS, not inline HTML.
