⭐️Question 2:
Why might an image not appear on your web page even if you've used the <img> element?

⭐️Question 3:
You’re making a simple blog. You want two images to appear on separate lines, even if there’s enough space for them side by side. What’s one way to do this?

1️⃣ Answer 1:
Use the href attribute on the second image
😎Why:
Why? href is for links and has no effect on image placement.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
Add a closing tag for <img>
😎Why:
Why? <img> is a void element and doesn’t require a closing tag; this won’t change layout.
--

3️⃣ ✅ Answer 3:
Wrap each image in a separate <p> tag
😎Why:
Why? Paragraph tags force images to appear on separate lines, behaving like block-level elements.

⭐️Question 4:
Which of the following is true about the src attribute in the <img> tag?

1️⃣ ✅ Answer 1:
It defines the URL of the image you want to show.

Why? The src attribute specifies the image’s path so the browser knows where to load it from.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
It styles the image with borders and padding.
😎Why:
Why? Styling is done using CSS, not through the src attribute.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
It provides alternate text for the image.

Whether the image URL in the src attribute is valid and reachable
😎Why:
Why? If the src path is broken or incorrect, the image won’t appear.

2️⃣ Answer 2:
If the image is wrapped inside an <h1> tag
😎Why:
Why? Wrapping the image in an <h1> doesn't prevent it from loading.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
Whether the image file is a .docx format
