⭐️Question 5:
Slightly challenging: How would you get the RGB color of a hovered link without hovering manually?

1️⃣ ✅ Answer 1:
Use the Inspect button, select the link, check "hover", then view background-color in Computed tab
😎Why:
Why? This technique simulates hover and reveals the style applied in that state.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
Click the link quickly and screenshot it
😎Why:
Why? This won’t show CSS properties—it’s a guess-and-check approach.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
Disable JavaScript

⭐️Question 7:
What happens to changes you made in DevTools after refreshing the page?

They disappear and the page resets
