gi⭐️Question 1:
Why is it helpful to keep the final design open while building a website?

1️⃣ ✅ Answer 1:
To compare your work to the end goal as you build
😎Why:
Why? Having the final design open helps ensure that each element you build matches the reference visually.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
So the browser loads faster
😎Why:
Why? The final design does not affect browser speed; it’s for visual comparison only.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
Because HTML won’t work otherwise
😎Why:
Why? HTML works fine without the reference design open; it’s just a good practice for developers.

⭐️Question 2:
You want to make a paragraph take up only 270px of width, like an image above it. What CSS property should you use?

1️⃣ ✅ Answer 1:
width
😎Why:
Why? The width property controls how wide an element is, and it works on text just like it does on images.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
font-size
😎Why:
Why? font-size changes how big the text appears, not how wide the paragraph container is.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
padding
😎Why:
Why? padding controls space inside the element, not its actual width.

⭐️Question 3:
A developer applies font-style: italic; to an image inside a paragraph. What happens?

1️⃣ Answer 1:
The image becomes tilted
😎Why:
Why? font-style doesn’t apply to images. Only text elements are affected by this property.
--

2️⃣ ✅ Answer 2:
The image remains unaffected
😎Why:
Why? font-style only affects text, not images or other non-text elements.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
The image text turns bold
😎Why:
Why? font-style doesn’t make text bold—it italicizes it. Also, it won’t apply to the image element.

⭐️Question 4:
A developer sets width: 270px on all img tags. Now your green dot icon is way too big. What’s the best fix?

1️⃣ ✅ Answer 1:
Use a class on the large image and target it specifically with CSS
😎Why:
Why? Using a class selector limits the style to the intended image and avoids affecting others.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
Use the same width for all images
😎Why:
Why? Not all images should have the same width. This can cause layout issues.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
Remove the width property from all images
😎Why:
Why? That would break your layout by removing necessary styles from other images.

⭐️Question 5:
Which CSS property is used to make text appear bold on a webpage?

1️⃣ Answer 1:
font-style
😎Why:
Why? font-style is used to make text italic, not bold.
--

2️⃣ ✅ Answer 2:
font-weight
😎Why:
Why? font-weight is the correct property to control text thickness, including making it bold.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
text-transform

⭐️Question 6:
You want to make paragraph lines easier to read by adding spacing between them. What CSS property should you use?

1️⃣ Answer 1:
font-weight
😎Why:
Why? font-weight affects how thick text appears, not spacing between lines.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
font-size
😎Why:
Why? font-size changes how large the text is, not the spacing between lines.
--

3️⃣ ✅ Answer 3:
line-height

Why? line-height controls the vertical spacing between lines in a paragraph, making text easier to read.

⭐️Question 7:
Why did the "font-style: italic" not tilt the green dot image?

1️⃣ Answer 1:
Because the image wasn’t placed in a <span>
😎Why:
Why? Element type doesn't matter here; <font-style> only affects text content regardless of container tag.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
Because font-style doesn’t work if applied inside a class
😎Why:
Why? Font-style works in a class, but it only applies to text, not images or other media.
--

3️⃣ ✅ Answer 3:
Because font-style only applies to text, not images
😎Why:
Why? CSS font-style is a text-only property and images are not affected by it.

⭐️Question 8:
Real-world scenario: You’re designing a section title that needs to be larger, bold, and uppercase. Which combination of properties will help you achieve this?

1️⃣ ✅ Answer 1:
font-size, font-weight, text-transform
😎Why:
Why? These three properties control size, boldness, and case—all necessary for a standout section title.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
width, color, padding
😎Why:
Why? These affect layout and color but won’t help with text styling like bold or uppercase.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
border, margin, text-align
😎Why:
Why? These properties help with spacing and alignment, not boldness, size, or text case.

⭐️Question 9:
Slightly challenging: You want to make a paragraph’s text smaller, tighter, and gray. Which combination would work?

1️⃣ Answer 1:
font-size: 24px; color: black; line-height: 30px;
😎Why:
Why? This increases font size and uses black text—opposite of the goal.
--

2️⃣ ✅ Answer 2:
font-size: 14px; color: gray; line-height: 22px;
😎Why:
Why? This combination matches exactly what was used to style the sidebar paragraph for clarity and design.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
font-style: italic; color: green; text-transform: uppercase;
😎Why:
Why? This makes text italic, green, and uppercase—not smaller or tighter spaced.
