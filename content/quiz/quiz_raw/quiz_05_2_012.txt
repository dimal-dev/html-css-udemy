<Question 2>
    <Description>
        Two CSS rules apply to the same paragraph. One sets font-size to 80px using a tag selector, and the other sets it to 40px using a class selector. What font size will the paragraph appear as?
    </Description>
    <Answer 1>
        <Is Correct>Yes</Is Correct>
        <Content>40px</Content>
        <Explanation>Why? The class selector is more specific than the tag selector, so its font-size value wins.</Explanation>
    </Answer 1>
    <Answer 2>
        <Is Correct>No</Is Correct>
        <Content>80px</Content>
        <Explanation>Why? Even if declared later, tag selectors are less specific and will be overridden by class selectors.</Explanation>
    </Answer 2>
    <Answer 3>
        <Is Correct>No</Is Correct>
        <Content>Both values will cancel out and the text will stay default size</Content>
        <Explanation>Why? CSS does not cancel styles. One rule overrides the other based on specificity.</Explanation>

<Question 3>
    <Description>
        Real-world scenario: You want each word in a title to begin with a capital letter. What value should you use for text-transform?
    </Description>
    <Answer 1>
        <Is Correct>No</Is Correct>
        <Content>uppercase</Content>
        <Explanation>Why? uppercase capitalizes all letters, not just the first letter of each word.</Explanation>
    </Answer 1>
    <Answer 2>
        <Is Correct>Yes</Is Correct>
        <Content>capitalize</Content>
        <Explanation>Why? capitalize turns only the first letter of each word into uppercase, which is perfect for titles.</Explanation>
    </Answer 2>
    <Answer 3>
        <Is Correct>No</Is Correct>
        <Content>first-letter</Content>
        <Explanation>Why? first-letter is a pseudo-element, not a value for text-transform.</Explanation>

<Question 4>
    <Description>
        Which of the following is TRUE about combining multiple CSS rules for one element?
    </Description>
    <Answer 1>
        <Is Correct>Yes</Is Correct>
        <Content>Different CSS rules can apply together if they change different properties</Content>
        <Explanation>Why? When rules affect different properties (like font-size and color), they add up and apply together.</Explanation>
    </Answer 1>
    <Answer 2>
        <Is Correct>No</Is Correct>
        <Content>Only the last CSS rule applies</Content>
        <Explanation>Why? All rules can apply unless there’s a conflict over the same property—then specificity decides.</Explanation>
    </Answer 2>
    <Answer 3>
        <Is Correct>No</Is Correct>
        <Content>Only inline styles apply</Content>
        <Explanation>Why? Inline styles do have high specificity but we’re discussing internal CSS rules here.</Explanation>

<Question 5>
    <Description>
        You applied two different CSS rules to a paragraph: one changes the font-size, and the other changes the text color and casing. What happens?
    </Description>
    <Answer 1>
        <Is Correct>No</Is Correct>
        <Content>Only the last rule gets applied</Content>
        <Explanation>Why? When rules change different properties, they are combined and applied together.</Explanation>
    </Answer 1>
    <Answer 2>
        <Is Correct>Yes</Is Correct>
        <Content>All properties from both rules are combined and applied</Content>
        <Explanation>Why? CSS allows multiple rules to apply as long as they affect different properties. They get merged together.</Explanation>
    </Answer 2>
    <Answer 3>
        <Is Correct>No</Is Correct>
        <Content>The rule with more lines overrides the other</Content>
        <Explanation>Why? CSS priority depends on specificity, not how many lines are in a rule.</Explanation>
