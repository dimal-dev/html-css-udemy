<Question 1>
    <Description>
        What’s the key difference between a tag selector and a class selector in CSS?
    </Description>
    <Answer 1>
        <Is Correct>No</Is Correct>
        <Content>
            A tag selector is used only for links, while a class selector is used for images.
        </Content>
        <Explanation>
            Why? Tag selectors can target any HTML tag (like p, a, img), not just links.
        </Explanation>
    </Answer 1>
    <Answer 2>
        <Is Correct>Yes</Is Correct>
        <Content>
            A tag selector targets all elements of a type, while a class selector targets elements with a specific class.
        </Content>
        <Explanation>
            Why? Tag selectors apply styles to all elements of a specific HTML tag, class selectors target elements with a specific class name.
        </Explanation>
    </Answer 2>
    <Answer 3>
        <Is Correct>No</Is Correct>
        <Content>
            A tag selector uses a dot before the name, while a class selector does not.
        </Content>
        <Explanation>
            Why? It’s the other way around—class selectors use a dot before the name, tag selectors do not.

<Question 2>
    <Description>
        You add the same class to three different images. What happens when you apply a CSS rule to that class?
    </Description>
    <Answer 1>
        <Is Correct>No</Is Correct>
        <Content>
            Only the first image will be affected by the CSS rule.
        </Content>
        <Explanation>
            Why? Class selectors apply the style to all elements with that class, not just the first one.
        </Explanation>
    </Answer 1>
    <Answer 2>
        <Is Correct>Yes</Is Correct>
        <Content>
            All three images will be styled according to the CSS rule.
        </Content>
        <Explanation>
            Why? Class selectors are designed to apply styles to any element that shares the specified class name.
        </Explanation>
    </Answer 2>
    <Answer 3>
        <Is Correct>No</Is Correct>
        <Content>
            The rule will only work if each image has a different class name.
        </Content>
        <Explanation>
            Why? One class can be used on multiple elements, and the rule still applies to all of them.

<Question 3>
    <Description>
        Real-world challenge: You want your company logo to be larger than the other images on the page. What’s the best way to do that with CSS?
    </Description>
    <Answer 1>
        <Is Correct>Yes</Is Correct>
        <Content>
            Add a class to the logo image and write a CSS rule that targets that class.
        </Content>
        <Explanation>
            Why? Class selectors let you target and style specific elements individually—even if they’re the same tag as others.
        </Explanation>
    </Answer 1>
    <Answer 2>
        <Is Correct>No</Is Correct>
        <Content>
            Use multiple tag selectors to style the images differently.
        </Content>
        <Explanation>
            Why? You can't differentiate images with tag selectors alone—they target all <img> tags.
        </Explanation>
    </Answer 2>
    <Answer 3>
        <Is Correct>No</Is Correct>
        <Content>
            Move the logo to a new HTML page to isolate its style.
        </Content>
        <Explanation>
            Why? That’s unnecessary and inefficient. Class selectors exist exactly for cases like this.

<Question 4>
    <Description>
        Which of the following is the correct CSS selector to target an element with class="header-img"?
    </Description>
    <Answer 1>
        <Is Correct>Yes</Is Correct>
        <Content>
            .header-img
        </Content>
        <Explanation>
            Why? The dot at the beginning signals a class selector and must match the exact class name.
        </Explanation>
    </Answer 1>
    <Answer 2>
        <Is Correct>No</Is Correct>
        <Content>
            #header-img
        </Content>
        <Explanation>
            Why? That’s an ID selector, not a class selector. Class selectors use a dot prefix.
        </Explanation>
    </Answer 2>
    <Answer 3>
        <Is Correct>No</Is Correct>
        <Content>
            header-img
        </Content>
        <Explanation>
            Why? This isn’t a valid selector on its own—it needs a dot to be a class selector or must be an actual HTML tag to be a tag selector.

<Question 5>
    <Description>
        You name a class “main-image” in your CSS but accidentally write class="main_img" in your HTML. What will happen?
    </Description>
    <Answer 1>
        <Is Correct>No</Is Correct>
        <Content>
            The browser will automatically correct the name and apply the styles.
        </Content>
        <Explanation>
            Why? Browsers do not fix incorrect class names. They must match exactly for the CSS to work.
        </Explanation>
    </Answer 1>
    <Answer 2>
        <Is Correct>No</Is Correct>
        <Content>
            Both styles will be applied.
        </Content>
        <Explanation>
            Why? If the names don’t match, the style rule won’t apply to that HTML element at all.
        </Explanation>
    </Answer 2>
    <Answer 3>
        <Is Correct>Yes</Is Correct>
        <Content>
            The style will not apply because the names don’t match exactly.
        </Content>
        <Explanation>
            Why? Class selectors are case-sensitive and require an exact match with the class name in HTML.
