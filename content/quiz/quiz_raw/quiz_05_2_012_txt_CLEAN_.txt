⭐️Question 2:
Two CSS rules apply to the same paragraph. One sets font-size to 80px using a tag selector, and the other sets it to 40px using a class selector. What font size will the paragraph appear as?

1️⃣ ✅ Answer 1:
40px
😎Why:
Why? The class selector is more specific than the tag selector, so its font-size value wins.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
80px
😎Why:
Why? Even if declared later, tag selectors are less specific and will be overridden by class selectors.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
Both values will cancel out and the text will stay default size
😎Why:
Why? CSS does not cancel styles. One rule overrides the other based on specificity.

⭐️Question 3:
Real-world scenario: You want each word in a title to begin with a capital letter. What value should you use for text-transform?

1️⃣ Answer 1:
uppercase
😎Why:
Why? uppercase capitalizes all letters, not just the first letter of each word.
--

2️⃣ ✅ Answer 2:
capitalize
😎Why:
Why? capitalize turns only the first letter of each word into uppercase, which is perfect for titles.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
first-letter
😎Why:
Why? first-letter is a pseudo-element, not a value for text-transform.

⭐️Question 4:
Which of the following is TRUE about combining multiple CSS rules for one element?

1️⃣ ✅ Answer 1:
Different CSS rules can apply together if they change different properties
😎Why:
Why? When rules affect different properties (like font-size and color), they add up and apply together.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
Only the last CSS rule applies
😎Why:
Why? All rules can apply unless there’s a conflict over the same property—then specificity decides.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
Only inline styles apply
😎Why:
Why? Inline styles do have high specificity but we’re discussing internal CSS rules here.

⭐️Question 5:
You applied two different CSS rules to a paragraph: one changes the font-size, and the other changes the text color and casing. What happens?

1️⃣ Answer 1:
Only the last rule gets applied
😎Why:
Why? When rules change different properties, they are combined and applied together.
--

2️⃣ ✅ Answer 2:
All properties from both rules are combined and applied
😎Why:
Why? CSS allows multiple rules to apply as long as they affect different properties. They get merged together.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
The rule with more lines overrides the other
😎Why:
Why? CSS priority depends on specificity, not how many lines are in a rule.
