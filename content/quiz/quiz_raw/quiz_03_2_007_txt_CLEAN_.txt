⭐️Question 1:
What is the difference between an absolute URL and a relative URL for an image in HTML?

1️⃣ ✅ Answer 1:
An absolute URL points to an image on the web, while a relative URL points to an image on your computer.
😎Why:
Why? Absolute URLs are complete web addresses, while relative URLs are paths to images within your website’s folders.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
An absolute URL is a type of file path on your computer, while a relative URL is a link to an image hosted online.
😎Why:
Why? Absolute URLs are for images on the web, not file paths on your computer.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
An absolute URL uses a file path that starts with "C:\" for Windows, while a relative URL does not.
😎Why:
Why? Absolute URLs contain the full address, including the domain and file path, while relative URLs are specific to your website’s folder structure.

⭐️Question 2:
After moving your image to a folder called "images" on your computer, which of the following should the src attribute look like to display the image properly?

1️⃣ ✅ Answer 1:
src="images/reddit-logo.png"
😎Why:
Why? The src attribute correctly points to the folder and image file in your website's directory.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
src="reddit-logo.png"
😎Why:
Why? This assumes the image is in the same folder as the HTML file, but it has been moved to a subfolder named "images."
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
src="my-website/images/reddit-logo.png"
😎Why:
Why? The path should be relative to your current HTML file location, and "my-website" may not be necessary if you're already inside that folder.

⭐️Question 3:
How can you turn an image into a clickable link in HTML?

1️⃣ ✅ Answer 1:
Wrap the image inside an anchor element with the href attribute pointing to the desired URL.
😎Why:
Why? Nesting an <img> element inside an anchor element <a> creates a clickable image that links to a URL.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
Use the href attribute inside the <img> tag to create the link.
😎Why:
Why? The href attribute should be used in the <a> tag, not the <img> tag.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
Add the link to the alt attribute of the <img> tag.
😎Why:
Why? The alt attribute provides alternative text for the image but does not make the image clickable.

⭐️Question 4:
What happens if you don't update the src attribute when you move an image to a different folder?

1️⃣ ✅ Answer 1:
The browser will show a broken image icon because it cannot find the image at the old path.
😎Why:
Why? If the src path isn't updated to reflect the new folder, the browser can’t locate the image and displays an error icon instead.
--

2️⃣ Answer 2:
The browser will automatically search for the image in the new folder.
😎Why:
Why? The browser doesn't automatically adjust file paths—it's crucial to update the src attribute when moving files.
--

3️⃣ Answer 3:
The image will appear with a small watermark indicating that it has been moved.
😎Why:
Why? The browser won't add any watermark; it simply cannot find the image at the specified location if the src path is incorrect.

--

Clicking an image to open a document saved on the user’s computer.

Why? For security reasons, browsers do not allow direct access to local files like this using <img> and <a>.
